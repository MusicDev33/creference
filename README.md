# creference

I don't anticipate too much trouble jumping into C, as I have some familiarity with low-level concepts, but everyone says pointers are hard, so I'm creating a little reference for myself (and others too!) to remind me of what I can do with pointers.

I'll also be messing around with other really weird things about C and its compiler optimizations.
